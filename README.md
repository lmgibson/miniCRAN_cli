# miniCRAN CLI

## Overview
A simple packaging of a couple aspects of the miniCRAN R library. The CLI can create a local repo
and it can add packages to an existing local repo. Requires that miniCRAN and argparse are
installed.

## To-Do
I need to create the tools so someone can build this on their own device. If someone wants
to use it in it's current form they can dowload 'addPackageToRepo.R' and symlink it or
write it into an alias.
