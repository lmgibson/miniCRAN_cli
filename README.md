# miniCRAN CLI

## Overview
A simple wrapper of a couple aspects of the miniCRAN R library. The CLI can create a local repo
and it can add packages to an existing local repo. Requires that miniCRAN and argparse are
installed. I put this together so I can quickly update my repo without launching R.

## Installation

1. Add the "minicran" file to your /usr/local/bin/ folder.
2. Test the command by typing `minicran`
3. If you've successfully installed it then you should receive an error prompting you to provide a list of packages.
